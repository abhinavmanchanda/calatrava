* You can specify the Android API version when creating a project with

  externally to the `ant` build to avoid `CLASSPATH` issues.

  was also required, this too has been fixed.
* [Issue #39][i39]: [ios] Network activity spinner
* [Issue #40][i40]: calatrava.bridge.request() seems to require a
  "failure" callback in the browser, although documented as "optional"
* [Issue #42][i42]: Fixes the MobileWeb app loading issue. Pages were
  hidden by default, but the `show` and `hide` implementations for the
  converter page were incomplete.
* [Issue #43][i43]: Close the load_file.txt reader after loading
  files, on Android.
* [iOS Issue #1][ios-i1]: Don't trigger all JS file loads at the same
  time as this can fail to load some files in large sets.
* [iOS Issue #4][ios-i4]: Calatrava apps should be able to open URLs
  using other apps on iOS.
* [Issue #25][i25]: Recreate `load_file.txt` during the build, if new

  of the build process.

  code.

  `web/app/source/alert.web.coffee`,
  `droid/test/src/com/calatrava/bridge/AlertPlugin.java` and
  `ios/Pods/calatrava/calatrava-ios/Bridge/AlertPlugin.m`.
* Substantial re-writing of the build tasks. Should largely not be
  externally visible, except there are a lot less tasks now.

  project as 'test' instead of the project name
